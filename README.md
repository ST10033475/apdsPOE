## Key Security Features

1. **Password Security**: 
   - Strong password policies implemented.
   - Secure password storage with hashing and salting using bcrypt.

2. **Input Whitelisting**:
   - All inputs are validated to prevent malicious data entries.

3. **Data Security**:
   - Sensitive data (ID number, account number, passwords) is encrypted in the database.
   - Data is transmitted over SSL to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Protection Against Attacks**:
   - **Helmet** is used to secure HTTP headers.
   - **Express Brute** is used to prevent brute-force login attempts.
   - CSRF protection is implemented.

5. **DevSecOps Pipeline**:
   - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline ensures security checks are integrated into development.
   - Security vulnerabilities are checked before deployment using tools like `Snyk` or `npm audit`.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Encryption**: Customer and employee passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- **SSL Encryption**: All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using SSL.
- **Rate Limiting**: Express Brute is implemented to protect against brute-force login attempts.
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens are used to secure form submissions.
